# Basic Recipe Website

This is a static website project using pure HTML as is customary with beginners to web development. The following software has been indispensable to this end:

- Emmet
- Prettier
- [Mozilla HTML docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML)
- HTML Preview (_VSCode extension_)

## Roadmap

- [x] Build initial basic HTML version
- [ ] ...
- [ ] Beautify the website
  - Rebuild in React

## Template

Refer to the file `./utilities/template.html` for a basic structure to be followed by each recipe page.

HTML table rows for ingredients can be created using the Python script in `./utilities/ingredients_parser.ipynb`
