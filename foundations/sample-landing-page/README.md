# Landing Page

<!-- A simple landing page using HTML and CSS -->

This is a static webpage project using a combination of HTML and CSS for showcasing layout and styling skills.

The following software resources has been indispensable to this end:

- Emmet
- Prettier
- CSS Flexbox
- Live Preview
- MDN Web docs

## Roadmap

- [x] Build the design as is
- [ ] Substitute actual content into the design
  - e.g. images, logos, fonts, color schemes
  - Use this as a GitHub Pages profile landing page?

## Design

These designs, as well as any modifications specific to this implementation, are available in a PowerPoint `.pptx` file under the `./misc/` directory.
